# Complementary materials
Here you can find some complementary materials for my thesis, which include:
- A JSON database with the structural information of all 114 structures determined for the InxOy/PdIn(001) system;
  - Obs: One can easily visualize this database using the "ase.db.connect" function using Python. More information on   https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/db/db.html?highlight=db#module-ase.db
- A PDF file with contain all the theoretical STM images also for the InxOy/PdIn(001) system. It include STM images with four bias voltages for each structure.
