Here you can find some complementary materials for my thesis, which include:
- A JSON database with the structural information of all 114 structures determined for the InxOy/PdIn(001) system;
- A PDF file with contain all the theoretical STM images also for the InxOy/PdIn(001) system. It include STM images with four bias voltages for each structure.
